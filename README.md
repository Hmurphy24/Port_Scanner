Port Scanner

This program was created using Python and displays the open ports on a specified IP or device name. The program takes in the range of ports to scan as user input and displays which ports in the specified range are currently open. 

In order to run this code, you must have a coding environment that can run Python scripts. Secondly, you must have the socket and datetime libraries installed since they are used in the program's port scanning and displaying how much time the scan took.
